# Overview

Repository for Mahit Mehta's 2024 refreshed personal website. Give it a look at [mahitm.com](https://mahitm.com)

# Colophon

>This project is a standard [Next.js 14.2](https://nextjs.org/docs) website bootstrapped with `create-next-app`. 

Here you can find various behind-the-scenes details about this website:

## Inspiration

Many of the ideas, including the document-styled format of the website, were inspired by one of my personal favorite open-source developers: Val Packett. Check out their personal website at [val.packett.cool](https://val.packett.cool/)!

## SVGs

Most of the SVGs, including the billboard and windows, were created by me using [Figma](https://figma.com). However, some SVGs, including the background buildings, are modified versions of SVGs available at [undraw.co](https://undraw.co) (Love this website). 

Furthermore, the SVG animations use free [Lottiefiles](https://lottiefiles.com/).

## Icons

The icons are a combination of [FontAwesome's](https://fontawesome.com/) free collection of icons and [Heroicon's](https://heroicons.com/) slick `outline` icons.

## Typefaces

This website is set in a new font I've been testing, including the billboard SVG: [Jersey 15](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jersey+15).

## Hosting

This website is hosted by [Vercel](vercel.app).

## Browser support

This website is best viewed on a desktop version of `Google Chrome`, however, any reasonably popular and recent browsers should be supported.
